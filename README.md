# Biocomputing-Analysis

**Goal**: Analyzed molecular screening data from two countries (X and Y) to determine the origin of a bacterial disease outbreak and assess the potential cross-country efficacy of a vaccine. Developed reusable R functions for automated data cleaning, compilation, and statistical analysis to support ongoing monitoring by the CDC.
Questions to answer:
1. Which country (X or Y) was the origin of the outbreak?
2. If Country Y develops a vaccine, will it work for citizens of Country X?
*Screening data (10 genetic markers per patient) from daily patient screenings in both countries were provided. Markers indicated infection presence and strain similarity.*
